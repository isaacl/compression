# Chess clock and move compression algorithms for lichess.org

## Disclaimer

This library was migrated from the Java language to the Scala language.
Only the language syntax changed to Scala; the design and paradigms of the Java program were kept.
This is not how Scala code should be written, it is not idiomatic.
